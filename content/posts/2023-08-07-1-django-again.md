I used [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) extensively when I was the Lead Developer at the (now) [Center for Academic Innovation](https://ai.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan.
It's been a while, but I recently decided to revisit it for a different project that I'm working on.
This is the first in a brief series of posts that document my re-introduction to the Django ecosystem.

These days, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for my development work.  VS Code has a nice [tutorial on getting started with Django](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-django), which I highly recommend.
I followed that tutorial and had a functioning "Hello, world" app in a few hours.
